This little Google Chrome extension helps Salesforce admins to login as another user.

When you work as a Salesforce administrator in orgs with lots of users you might find it difficult to login as another user. 
You not only have to navigate Setup with tons of clicks, find the correct user, login and then find your context again. Not cool...

From now on you can use this little Google Chrome Extension which will let you login as any user directly without losing focus to the current open Salesforce page.

Pretty awesome, right? ðŸ¥³

## Features

- Query all active users with a standard Salesforce license
- Search the list of users by first name, last name, profile name or user role name
- Login as any user by a single click
- Logout again at any time and automatically get back to the page you came from prior login

## Install

TBD
